One can try the livro.txt file by running the following:

./bingchiling -c < livro.txt > saida.txt 
./bingchiling -d < saida.txt > texto.txt 

This way the whole A Christmas Carrol book will be encrypted and decrypted. Just notice it HAS to be all one string (no '\n')
and it HAS to have a '\n' at the end of the file.

Have fun :D
